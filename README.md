# Skript
You can find my Skript projects here.


## How to use my scripts?
### 1. install the required plugins
All of my scripts need the *Skript* plugin installed on your server. Most of them have other requirements too, you can find those inside the *"requirements.txt"* file in every folder.

### 2. Put the script into the right folder
After you've installed the required plugins, you'll need to put the script into the **plugins/Skript/scripts** folder. Then if you start your server, you should be able to use my script.


## My projects
### CoolExplosions
This script is for better looking minecraft explosions. It mostly uses falling blocks to make the blocks fly away, up or even towards the explosion.
#### Explosion Types
    - `burst:` The blocks burst away from the center of the explosion.
    - `burst_random:` The blocks burst away in random order.
    - `opposite:` The blocks burst away in the opposite direction the're supposed to
    - `upwards:` The blocks only launch upwards (at the same time), then fall back to the ground.
    - `upwards_random:` The blocks launch upwards in random order.
    - `none:` CoolExplosions is turned off.
#### Available Settings
    - Explosion Force
    - Additional force upwards
    - Extra Damage to nearby entities
    - Chance to destroy blocks instead of launching them

# Skript
You can find my Skript projects here.

## How to use my scripts?
### 1. install the required plugins
All of my scripts need the *Skript* plugin installed on your server. Most of them have other requirements too, you can find those inside the *"requirements.txt"* file in every folder.

### 2. Put the script into the right folder
After you've installed the required plugins, you'll need to put the script into the **plugins/Skript/scripts** folder. Then if you start your server, you should be able to use my script.
